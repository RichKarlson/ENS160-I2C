# ENS160-I2C
C library for basic I2C communication between an AVR microcontroller and an ENS160 sensor

Originally coded to interface an ATmega644p and a DFRobot ENS160 sensor but should work with ATmega164P/324P/644P. Other AVR microcontrollers can utilise this library by simply changing the relavent TWI register information.
